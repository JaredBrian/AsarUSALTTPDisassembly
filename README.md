# AsarUSALTTPDisassembly

A WIP US disassembly for The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past made to work with the Asar SNES assembler. Based off of the MathOnNapkins' disassembly but cleaned up with additional notes, labels, missing data from the original, and cross referenced with Kan's USDASM assembly.

# AsarUSALTTPDisassembly

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is still a work in process and CANNOT currently build on its own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a WIP disassembly for the USA version of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. The purpose of this dissasembly is to provide a buildable sasembly using the Asar SNES assembler, to provide further code clarification from other disassemblies, to provide comprehensive RAM maps, and to reorganize data and code in a more human readable way. This disassembly is based off of the MathOnNapkins' disassembly but has been cleaned up with additional notes, labels, and missing data from the original. This disassembly has also been cross referenced with Kan's USDASM assembly and has additional notes marking places and code that the Zcream ALTTP editor by Zarby89 has changed and or moved.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is mostly just for my own personal use. The way the code and data are formatted are that way becuase it roughly follows coding standards that I like and that I personally find the most readable. If you prefer a more traditional single "opcode per line" or "address on every line" disassembly, I reccomend taking a look at Kan's USA disassembly. All of the code comments and labels changed are based on my own research, testing, and educated guesswork. Nothing should be taken as gospel and there are bound to be plenty of errors and code or RAM descriptions that are just plain wrong. If you find any such issues please let me know by creating an issue here on github or on Discord TODO: INSERT DISCORD LINK. However, regaurdless of bad code labels and once completed, the final re-assembled product from this disasembly will be an exact working copy of a vanilla ALTTP ROM with no bytes differences.

# AsarUSALTTPDisassembly

A WIP US disassembly for The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past made to work with the Asar SNES assembler. Based off of the MathOnNapkins' disassembly but cleaned up with additional notes, labels, and missing data from the original. This assembly has also been cross referenced with Kan's USDASM assembly and has additional notes marking places and code that the ZScream ALTTP editor by Zarby89 has changed and or moved.
